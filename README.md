# Technical Documentation

Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia maintained by a model of open collaboration, and they provide free access to their data through the MediaWiki API. This project is an experience where I used Vue and the MediaWiki API to build this recreation of the famous Wikipedia. I'm not this designs original creator, but it's so amazing that I decided to use it as a model for this. You can find the url for the original design in the reference section of this page. It's important to mention that it's just a study and not a finished project, so many features are not done yet. Bugs are expected.
